Calldorado SDK Template license terms

Version 1, August 2017

1.Definitions
“snippets” means the software/code templates provided to the Pubisher by Calldorado under these terms.
SDK (Software Development Kit) is a collection of software used for developing applications for a specific device or operating system.

2.Granting of license
Calldorado grants the Publisher a non-exclusive, time-limited, non-transferrable right to copy, modify, merge and use the code snippets and documentation in those countries in which the Publisher operates. The code may be used only for the Publisher’s own internal business purposes. The license is granted until the expiry or termination of the terms according to which the Publisher has been given permission to use the code, or these terms, howsoever caused. The aforesaid is subject to the Publisher meeting the standards and specifications set out in these terms or any other terms agreed between Calldorado and the Publisher regarding the use of the code.

3.Versioning
The code snippets are versioned according to the following setup: {MAJOR}.{MINOR}.{PATCH}. Major and minor version changes cover new functionality and determine that updating needs attention as code changes might be needed and regressions testing is needed. Patch changes in a version are small upgrades that do not affect functionality.

Generally, support is not provided for old version versions back from the most recently released version, however, normal support will always be provided via the normal Calldorado support channel for issues releated to the SDK.

Example: Version 3.8.0 has just been released – latest previous version is 3.6.4. This means that version 3.6.4 is no longer supported, and users of this version must therefore upgrade to at latest version 3.8.0 in order to be entitled to support or expected to handle any issues on their own.

If a security issue or breach is discovered, a patch is released. In this situation, an upgrade to the latest version is expected and informed directly, and Publishers must upgrade or adapt within an agreed timeframe. This means that all versions prior to the security fix will be nullified and unsupported.


4.Disclaimer of warranty
The code is provided “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including without limitation any warranties or condition of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. The Publisher is responsible solely for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the snippets and assumes any risks associated with the Publisher’s exercise of permissions under the license.

5.Limitation of liability
In no event will Calldorado or its contributors be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary or consequential damages (including, but not limited to, procurement of substitute goods or services, loss of use, data or profits; or business interruption) however caused, whether in contract, strict liability or tort arising in any way out of the use of this code.

6.Open Source software
The snippets may include source code which is licensed under an open source license agreement (“MIT License”). Use of the Open Source Software is subject those terms and conditions. The Licensee accepts to be bound by and comply with all such terms and conditions. Calldorado disclaims any liability for any third party claims, including, but not limited to, any infringement claims, relating to the Publisher’s use of the Open Source Software.

7.Assignment
The Publisher may not assign its rights and obligations under these terms in any way without Calldorado's prior written consent.

8.Content obligations
The Publisher is not allowed to monetize the native fields, hence in any way having content that can be used to gain money directly or indirectly.
It is expected that no Inappropriate or schocking content is shown and all content are inline with the app and would be expected as such by the end user.

9.Termination
Upon expiry or termination of use of Calldorado and according to these terms, howsoever caused, Calldorado disables the Publisher ID provided by Calldorado to the Publisher for the use of this code, and the Publisher can no longer use the code provided under these terms.
