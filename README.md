# Calldorado Templates

A collection of native templates that can be used with the Calldorado SDK to integrate your own functionality in the Caller ID. The templates provided here are meant as a starting point, we highly encourage you to built on top of the code we give you.

## Introduction

This is a guide of how to integrate native views and actions into Calldoradoâ€™s UI. You should be familiar with the Calldorado SDK and have a basic working integration of Calldorado before proceeding. If you do not, please have a look [here](https://my.calldorado.com/) under Integration and Documentation.

There are three areas where you can provide your own functionality. Two of those areas are part of the WIC - the floating box that appears during a call to identify the caller - and the third one is part of the Aftercall screen - the details page that comes after the call ends.

*	Custom action on the WIC; allow users to perform custom actions during a call
*	Custom UI on the WIC; show the user content from your app during a call
*	Custom UI in the Aftercall screen; show content on the call details page
